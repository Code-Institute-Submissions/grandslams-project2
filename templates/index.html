                        <p>The Grand Slam tournaments, also called majors, are the four most important annual tennis events. They offer 
                        the most ranking points, prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and 
                        greater number of "best of" sets for men. The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January, 
                        the French Open in May and June, Wimbledon in July, and the US Open in August and September. Each tournament is 
                        played over a period of two weeks. The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the 
                        French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass. </p>

                        <p>Since the year 2003 men's tennis has been dominated by Rodger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray
                        and Novak D]okovic. Out of the available 61 grandslams 51 were won by the big four. Stan Wawrinka has three wins to his name
                        the same number as Murray, however he has only one final loss against Murrays 8.</p>
                        <p>Remarkably the calender grandslam evaded each man, with Federer being short of the French open on three occasions. Novak 
                        held all grandslams at the same time winning Wimbledon and the US open in 2015 and completing the set in 2016 with the 
                        Australian open and Roland Garros.</p>
                        <p>All four men have seen their 30th birthdays come and pass but continue to play fantastic tennis in what has been 
                        dubbed 'the golden era' for mens tennis. The bar has been trully raised and it has been a joy to witness.</p>
